### üîë 2. Add the user to the `sudo` group

Ubuntu uses the `sudo` group (sometimes called `admin` on older versions) to grant sudo privileges.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo newusername
```

The `-aG` flag means **append** (`a`) the user to the **group** (`G`) named `sudo`.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Verify the user‚Äôs sudo access

Switch to the new user:

```bash
su - newusername
```

Then test sudo:

```bash
sudo whoami
```

If everything is correct, it should print:

```
root
```

---

### üß± (Optional) 4. Grant passwordless sudo access

If you want this user to use `sudo` without entering a password (use with caution):

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Then add a line like this at the end:

```
newusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
