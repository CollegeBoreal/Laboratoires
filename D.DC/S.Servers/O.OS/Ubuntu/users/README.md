Hereâ€™s a clear step-by-step guide to **add a new user with sudo privileges** on Ubuntu ðŸ‘‡

---

### ðŸ§© 1. Create the new user

```bash
sudo adduser 300099999
```
<details>

```lua
[sudo] password for ubuntu: 
err: To avoid ambiguity with numerical UIDs, usernames which
            consist of only digits are not allowed.
```

</details>

* Replace `newusername` with the actual username you want.
* Youâ€™ll be prompted to create a password and optionally fill in user info.

---

### ðŸ”‘ 2. Add the user to the `sudo` group

Ubuntu uses the `sudo` group (sometimes called `admin` on older versions) to grant sudo privileges.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo newusername
```

The `-aG` flag means **append** (`a`) the user to the **group** (`G`) named `sudo`.

---

### âœ… 3. Verify the userâ€™s sudo access

Switch to the new user:

```bash
su - newusername
```

Then test sudo:

```bash
sudo whoami
```

If everything is correct, it should print:

```
root
```

---

### ðŸ§± (Optional) 4. Grant passwordless sudo access

If you want this user to use `sudo` without entering a password (use with caution):

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Then add a line like this at the end:

```
newusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

Would you like me to show the **one-liner version** (a single command sequence) to create and configure the sudo user all at once?
